# Cplusplus-Program
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I developed a program that would be used to teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility. I was able to develop an application that would allow users to see how their investments would grow over time. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I kept my code readable by seprerating everything into 1 h file and 2 cpp files. I was also able to use pointers successfully.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One way that I could enhance my code is by creating an additional function that would contain all of the items for displaying the menu. This would then clear out the main function and make the code even more readable.

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the use of a pointer a bit challenging to use at first, but I was able to read additional information to overcome this. I also used pseudocode and a flowchart to help me stay on track.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Keeping everything I code in its seperate functions is a skill that will be particularly transferable to other projects. Naming variables with the proper conventions is also another great skill.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by creating specific functions that only do specific actions. If values change in the future, updating only one location will be neccessary. Also variables are named so that they can be easily understood and identified.
